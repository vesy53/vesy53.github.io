                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest of people
                        regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top fashion magazines. Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.
                        <br/>
                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance, auto manufacturing,
                        property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent
                        part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an
                        official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.
                        <br/>
                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story.
                        <br/>
                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act amazingly human. After working at
                        Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence
                        of these genius machines: Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’ genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve
                        themselves. Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.

                        <h2>Albert Einstein Hubo</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Albert Einstein Hubo debuted in November 2005 at the APEC meeting in Seoul, Korea. The culmination of collaboration between Hanson Robotics and the Korean Advanced Science and Technology Institute, the robot is
                        the world's first natural chapter mounted on a robot framework for a walk in life. In 2009, Dr. Hanson gave TED Talk in Long Beach, California, where he demonstrated the ability of Einstein HUBO to understand
                        and mimic facial expressions. Over the years, Einstein Hubo has appeared in numerous conferences, gaining wide recognition (and more than a little horror) among those who have seen him.
                        <br/>
                        He is currently spending time with scientists at the University of California at San Diego Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technology, where he helps them understand how robots and people
                        perceive their emotions and interpret the facial scars. Their thinking is that if Einstein Hubo develops emotional intelligence, it will help researchers pave the way for robots to participate and improve
                        education, healthcare, fine arts, and customer service.
