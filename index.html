                        </header>
                        <p>
                            Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest of people
                            regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top fashion magazines. Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.
                            <br/>
                            Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance, auto
                            manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how robotics and artificial
                            intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by
                            United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.
                            <br/>
                            Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story.
                            <br/>
                            Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act amazingly human.
                            After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively human traits must be
                            integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines: Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’ genius machines can evolve
                            to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves. Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.

                            <h2>Albert Einstein Hubo</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            Albert Einstein HUBO debuted in November 2005 at the APEC Summit in Seoul, Korea. The culmination of a collaboration between Hanson Robotics and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
                            Technology, the robot is the world’s first android head mounted on a life-size walking robotic frame.  In 2009, Dr. Hanson gave a TED Talk in Long Beach, California, where he demonstrated
                            Einstein HUBO’s ability to understand and mimic facial expressions. In the years in between, Einstein HUBO appeared at numerous conferences, winning widespread acclaim (and more than a
                            little consternation) among those who saw him.
                            <br/>
                            He currently spends his time with scientists at UC San Diego’s California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, where he helps them understand how robots and humans
                            alike perceive emotions and interpret facial cues. Their thinking is, if Einstein HUBO can develop emotional intelligence, it will help researchers pave the way for robots to participate and
                            help improve education, healthcare, fine arts, and customer service.
